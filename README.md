# 🍽️ **Food Menu App** 🍽️
> Where You Have the World at your Fingertips! 🎉

Welcome to the **Food Menu App**, a deliciously curated collection of world cuisines, all in one place. This **Single Page Application (SPA)** serves up ten unique food items, allows you to **like, dislike**, and **leave comments** on each dish, making it as interactive as it is mouth-watering!

---

## 🍔 **Project Overview**
The **Food Menu App** leverages the **Foodish API** to display a selection of delicious food images. But we’ve added a twist! Instead of showing random images, we make sure each dish is **unique**, ensuring you don’t get served the same dish twice. Each food item is paired with its name and category, allowing you to:
- 👍 **Like** or 👎 **Dislike** each dish.
- 💬 **Leave comments** on your favorite (or not-so-favorite) dishes.

---

## 🌟 **Features**
- **10 Unique Dishes**: No repetitive food here! Each image represents a different dish from a variety of categories.
- **Like & Dislike**: Express your culinary preferences with a quick click!
- **Comment Section**: Got something to say about that pizza? Share your thoughts!
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All the magic happens on one page. No reloads, no distractions.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you're on desktop or mobile, the app looks deliciously good.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-gallery-app.git
cd food-gallery-app
```

### 2. **Install live-server**
If you’re running the app locally, make sure you have `live-server` installed:
```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

### 3. **Run the app**
Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, or use the local server (like `Live Server` in VSCode) to view the app.

---

## 📜 **Usage**
Once the app is loaded, you can:
1. **Browse** through 10 beautifully rendered food images.
2. **Like or Dislike** any food item by clicking on the respective button.
3. **Comment** on any dish to share your opinion.
4. **Watch the stats** for likes and dislikes update in real-time.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS3**: Stylish and responsive design for a sleek user experience.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powering the interactivity, asynchronous API requests, and dynamic content rendering.
- **Foodish API**: Provides a variety of delicious food images, served with love.

---

## 🧠 **How It Works**
1. **API Integration**: The app fetches food images asynchronously from the **Foodish API** using the `fetch()` method.
2. **Unique Items**: Duplicate categories are filtered out to ensure each food item is unique.
3. **Event Listeners**: The app listens for clicks on the like, dislike, and comment buttons, and updates the UI dynamically.
4. **Real-time Updates**: Likes, dislikes, and comments are displayed and updated without page reloads, giving the user a seamless experience.

## 💻 **Code Structure**
```bash
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # Stylesheet for the app
└── script.js         # JavaScript logic for fetching data, handling likes, dislikes, and comments
```
